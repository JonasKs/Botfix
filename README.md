# Discord bots
Different discord bots running on Python3 for multiple purposes. 

# Botfix  
Bot made to update a database on a private website. This is probably not interesting for anyone unless you would like to host a Discord bot that can update an SQL database, or just want some reference code.

# Hotbot
A bot made purely for testing purposes. Checks a blizzard armory and comparing stats. Not pretty, but works.
